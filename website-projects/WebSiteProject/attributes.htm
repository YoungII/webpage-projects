<h2>Attributes</h2>
   <p>
      A web page invokes server-side processing by either an attribute on a form or by a hyperlink (the URL of the script is used). Any form data that exists is passed to the script. The script completes its processing and may generate a confirmation or response web page with the requested information. When invoking a server-side script, the web developer and the server-side programmer must communicate about the form method attribute, form action attribute, and any special form element controls expected by the server-side script.
   </p>
  <div id ="section">
		<div id="News1"><h1>Method Attribute</h1> 
		<p> The method attribute is used on the form tag to indicate the way in which the name and value pairs should be passed to the server. The method attribute value ofget causes the form data to be appended to the URL, which is easily visible and not secure. The method attribute value of post does not pass the form information in the URL; it passes it in the entity body of the HTTP request, which makes it more private. The W3C recommends the method="post" method. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="News2"><h1>Action Attribute</h1>
		<p> The action attribute is used on the form tag to invoke a server-side script. The name attribue and the value attribute associated with each form control are passed to the server-side script. The name attribute may be used as a variable name in the server-side processing. </p>
